Affirmly
With the current state of the world as it is, there are several negative events that take place on a daily, weekly, and even monthly basis. Being exposed to this negativity can create a feeling of sadness that oozes in our everyday life that has the potential to make the most minuscule task seem like the most challenging thing we’ve ever encountered. Although being exposed to an abhorrent number of negative stimuli, we find the strength to complete the necessary task that will make us one step closer to achieving our goals. If we’re able to complete all the tests that we prioritized, shouldn’t there be some sort of positive stimuli to counteract the excessive number of negative stimuli of we were exposed to while attempting to complete? This very question is what led to the creation of Affirmly. Affirmly is a to-do list but has unique features that rewards your efforts with positively and encourages forming healthy habits.
